# CEBP-b-WT-and-KI-Mice-

**This repository consists of RNA-seq analysis for the heart tissue samples from CebpbAMut knockin mice versus control mice.**

**The RNA-seq workflow consists of these steps:**

* Pre-processing
* Alignment
* Differential Expresion analysis in R
* Data Visualization ( PCA, HeatMap, and Volcano Plots)
* GO and Pathways Analysis

**Output:** Venn diagrams, Volcano plot and heatmaps for differentially expressed genes
